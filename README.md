<h3>Nightlife Social Web App</h3>

The main portion and purpose of this database is to see how many people go to bars, how many drinks are bought, and how these two things can be influenced by other factors. The factors that can influence the choice that individuals make throughout the night are drinks and drink specials.

We are interested in tracking this data because with the right information, it could potentially turn into a scalable business. As of for now, we are tracking the amount of people buying drinks from bars and seeing how much specials influence. From here, we can move it towards a mobile app and make it related to Social Media in some way or another.
